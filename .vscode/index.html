              Throughout their range, habitats preferred by American black bears 
              have a few shared characteristics. They are often found in areas 
              with relatively inaccessible terrain, thick understory vegetation 
              and large quantities of edible material (especially masts). The 
              adaptation to woodlands and thick vegetation in this species may 
              have originally been due to the American black bear having evolved 
              alongside larger, more aggressive bear species, such as the extinct 
              giant short-faced bear and the still-living grizzly bear, that 
              monopolized more open habitats and the historic presence of 
              larger predators, such as Smilodon and the American lion, that could 
              have preyed on American black bears. Although found in the largest 
              numbers in wild, undisturbed areas and rural regions, American black 
              bears can adapt to surviving in some numbers in peri-urban regions, as 
              long as they contain easily accessible foods and some vegetative coverage
